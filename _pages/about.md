I am a researcher interested in strategy and decision making, focusing primarily on game theory, optimization, and reinforcement learning. I'm especially interested in decision-making and learning in dynamic settings containing other strategic agents, where information may be limited and one must adapt to changes in the environment.    

In August 2023, I joined the ECE Department at the University of Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow, where I am happy to work with [Lacra Pavel](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~pavel/) on various topics in learning and dynamics in games.  

Previously, I received my PhD from the department of mathematics and statistics at Queen's University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Serdar Yüksel](https://mast.queensu.ca/~yuksel/) and [Gürdal Arslan](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~gurdal/). Before that, I was at McGill University, where I majored in mathematics and economics. 


**Research Interests:** 
- learning in games
- optimization algorithms
- reinforcement learning (esp. multi-agent and partially observed RL)
- mean-field games

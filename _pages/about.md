I’m an applied mathematician and machine learning researcher at the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms.

My research interests are varied and interdisciplinary, but mostly revolve around multi-agent learning and game theory. 

Before moving to Mila, I was a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. Prior to that, I received my PhD in Mathematics from Queen’s University. 


**Research Interests:** 
- learning in games
- multi-agent reinforcement learning  
- mean-field games

For a complete list of papers and preprints, please check out my [publications page.](https://yongac.github.io/publications/)

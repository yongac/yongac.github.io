Hello! I am a postdoctoral fellow in the department of mathematics and statistics at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. I received my PhD in December 2022, and I was fortunate to be advised by [Serdar Yüksel](https://mast.queensu.ca/~yuksel/) and [Gürdal Arslan](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~gurdal/).

My research interests generally fall into two categories:
  1. The design and analysis of learning algorithms for sequential decision-making problems. This includes models such as multi-armed bandits, (partially observed) Markov decision problems, and stochastic games.
  2. Understanding how strategic learning agents interact. I want to understand how and why certain collective behaviours emerge in multi-agent settings. To make sense of these questions, I investigate structural properties of various game theoretic models.


For a list of papers and preprints, please check out my [publications page.](https://yongac.github.io/publications/)

I am an applied mathematician who specializes in multi-agent systems and game theory.

I received my PhD from Queen's University under the supervision of Serdar Yüksel and Gürdal Arslan (University of Hawaii). After Queen's, I had the pleasure of doing postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Toronto, where I was mentored by Lacra Pavel, and at Mila, where I was mentored by Gauthier Gidel.

**Current Interests:** 
- learning in games
- multi-agent reinforcement learning  
- large-scale auctions
- mechanism design for online auctions

* (March 2024) My co-authors and I have written two new papers on game theory, and their pre-prints are now available on arXiv: [link to paper 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18079); [link to paper 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18086). These papers explore how the idea of "satisficing" appears in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

* Our paper ["Independent Learning and Subjectivity in Mean-Field Games"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9992399) has been awarded an **Outstanding Student Paper Prize** by the *2023 Networks and Communication Systems Technical Committee*!
* (May 2023) I gave a talk on learning in stochastic and mean-field games at [9th Meeting on System and Control Theory](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~cnielsen/MSCT/2023/) in Waterloo.
* Our [paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/22M1515112) on the structure and algorithmic consequences of $\epsilon$-satisficing paths in stochastic games was accepted for publication to SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science.
* (February 2023) I delivered a [talk](https://www.gerad.ca/en/events/2062) in the GERAD seminar at Polytechnique Montreal about some work on learning dynamics in games.
